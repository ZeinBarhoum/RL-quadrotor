# Reinforcement Learning for Quadrotor trajectory planning and control

This project is divided into two parts, each represents a separate application of RL in Quadrotors: 
1. Path planning and trajectory generation for the Quadrotor
2. Control of the Quadrotor to achieve a specific trajectory 

This project is implemented as a course project for the 'Machine Learning In Robotics' course.
